# How Scientists Lie â€“ Book Repository

This is the work-in-progress repo for the book [**How Scientists Lie**](https://howscientistslie.com/) by [Peter M. Dahlgren](https://peterdahlgren.com/).

The book is built using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).

## Compile website

Compile the book by opening `index.rmd` in RStudio and press `Build Book`. This will create files in a new folder called `_book`.

An alternative way is to run `build_site.cmd` (however, check the path to the `RScript` executable).

## Directories

- `_includes` contains misc files that are included when compiling the book.
- `css ` contains style sheets for the webiste.
- `data` contains data used in the book.
- `images` contains images, graphics, and figures.
- `videos` contains video clips used on the website.

Edit the book contents using the RMarkdown files in the root folder.
