# Preface {-}

The purpose of this book is to become the goto resource about questionable research practices, the steroids of research, and to provide a pedagogical and educational introduction to these practices, and suggest remedies.

The main point I am trying to make is that questionable research practices are fundamentally about *reasoning*. [Excluding outliers](#outlier-exclusion), for example, may be related to statistics but the exclusion depends on the reasons given. In other words, there are no statistics in the world that can tell researchers to exclude.^[This relates to the difference between *ontological subjectivity* and *epistemological objectivity* [@hacking_social_1999]. For example, to exclude outliers or not is subjective, but *how* you exclude outliers is objective.] This means that the "errors of reasoning and irresponsible conclusions from the quantitative case originate from acts, which in principle are performed exactly the same in qualitative research" [@de_groot_meaning_1956, 8]. In order to understand these acts, we need to understand what questionable research practices are and how researchers use them. 

To understand what researchers do is important but an understudied area of science. As @mahoney_scientist_1976 pointed out, "can we afford to glibly accept the truths of science without gauging the limitations of its primary instrument?" [-@mahoney_scientist_1976, 14].

This book is free of charge. Books at scientific publishing companies are usually too expensive for anyone to buy and receives little attention. Why not just put it online?

## Outline {-}

- **[Chapter 1](#qrp)** describes what questionable research practices (QRPs) are.
- **[Chapter 2](#catalogue)** outlines several types of questionable research practices that has been identified in the research literature.
* **[Chapter 3](#reasons)** introduces several explanations to why questionable research practices occur.
- **[Chapter 4](#remedies)** suggests how questionable research practices can be prevented.
- In the appendix you'll also find **[resources and tools](#resources)** that can help with your work, as well as a [history of QRPs](#qrps-history).

## About the author {-}

[Peter M. Dahlgren](https://peterdahlgren.com/), PhD, studies metascience, selective information search, and confirmation bias.

## Roadmap {-}

Path towards the 1st edition:

‚òëÔ∏è Build website   
‚òëÔ∏è Flesh out book structure   
üü¶ Expand catalogue of QRPs and their prevalence   
üü¶ Expand catalogue of reasons for QRPs   
üü¶ Expand catalogue of remedies   
üü¶ Continuous peer review   
üü¶ Proofread   
üü¶ Provide downloadable PDF and EPUB

The book is written in Markdown using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) R package. The website was released 2022-04-28 and was last built on `r Sys.Date()`. Current word count: `r format_number(word_count())`. The website is updated now and then to reflect the progress.
