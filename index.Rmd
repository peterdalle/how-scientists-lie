# How Scientists Lie {- #intro}

<a href="/preface.html"><img src="images/cover.png" width="300" height="500" class="cover mb-5" alt="Book cover" /></a>

How do scientists lie? Which strategies do they use? The book [*How Scientists Lie*](https://howscientistslie.com/) provides a catalogue of questionable research practices, or QRPs, the steroids of research. It's a book about how bad research practices drive away the good ones, and how bad practices can be identified and rectified.

This book is for students and junior researchers in the social sciences, the natural sciences, and the humanities, as well as others who have an interest in empirical research that does not mislead.
