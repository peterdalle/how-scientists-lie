# Welcome to How Scientists Lie {-}

<a href="./"><img src="images/cover.png" width="300" height="500" class="cover" alt="Book cover" /></a>

How do scientists lie? Which strategies do they use? The book [*How Scientists Lie*](https://howscientistslie.com/) provides a catalogue of questionable research practices (QRPs), the steroids of research.

This book is for students, junior researchers, and others who have an interest in research that does not mislead.

# Preface {-}

The purpose of this book is to become the goto resource about questionable research practices, the steroids of research, and to provide a pedagogical and educational introduction to these practices and suggest remedies.

The main point I am trying to make in this book is that questionable research practices are fundamentally about *reasoning*. [Excluding outliers](#outlier-exclusion), for example, may be related to statistics but the exclusion depends on the reasons given. There are no statistics in the world that can tell researches to exclude.^[This relates to the difference between *ontological subjectivity* and *epistemological objectivity* [@hacking_social_1999]. For example, to exclude outliers or not is subjective, but *how* you exclude outliers is objective.] This means that the "errors of reasoning and irresponsible conclusions from the quantitative case originate from acts, which in principle are performed exactly the same in qualitative research" [@de_groot_meaning_1956, 8].

The book is free of charge. Books at scientific publishing companies are usually too expensive and receives little attention. Why not just put it online for everyone?

## Outline {-}

- **[Chapter 1](#qrp)** describes what questionable research practices (QRPs) are.
- **[Chapter 2](#catalogue)** outlines several types of questionable research practices that has been identified in the research literature.
- **[Chapter 3](#remedies)** suggests how questionable research practices can be prevented.
* **[Chapter 4](#reasons)** introduces several explanations to why questionable research practices occur.
* **[Chapter 5](#resources)** shows resources and tools that can help your work.

## About the author {-}

[Peter M. Dahlgren](https://peterdahlgren.com/), PhD, studies metascience, selective information search, and confirmation bias.

## Roadmap {-}

‚òëÔ∏è Build website   
üü¶ Expand catalogue of QRPs and their prevalence   
üü¶ Expand catalogue of remedies   
üü¶ Continuous peer-review   
üü¶ Proofread   

The book is written in Markdown using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) R package and was last built on `r Sys.Date()`.
